# React Recursive-Accordion Example

## Getting Started

1. install  
    `> npm install`
2. run  
    `> npm start`
3. Open a browser to  
    //localhost:1234

## Notes

- Runs on Parcel
- Not intended to be used as a library on its own
- Could be made into a library, so long as the functions for tree-building/toggling/collapsing are exported and used in the consumer of the accordion, and aren't buried inside of the accordion, itself
